Week 1 Task Mern Stack 

Basic CRUD Application

Concepts:  

 React: Components, JSX, Props, useState
 Node.js: Express setup, Routing, REST APIs
 MongoDB: Atlas setup, Mongoose Schema, Basic CRUD
Task:

 Build a "Todo List" (Frontend + Backend + DB)
•	React: Create a form to add/delete todos (use useState).
•	Node.js: Build a /todos API (GET, POST, DELETE).
•	MongoDB: Store todos in a Todo collection.

Flow of task
The user will create a task using a form that includes the following fields:  { title, description, date, assignedTo }. Once submitted, the task should be displayed in a list, which is dynamically updated through a GET request. Each task item in the list will include a Delete button, which, when clicked, should trigger a delete functionality to remove the task from the list.

Note: Edit functionality is not required at this stage.(Did It Anyway)
